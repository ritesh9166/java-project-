This Java project is an implementation of face detection using OpenCV library. The project uses Haar-like features and Cascade Classifier to detect faces in a given image. Here is a brief explanation of the code:

The project belongs to the "com.jfacedetection" package.

First, the code loads the OpenCV library by calling "System.loadLibrary(Core.NATIVE_LIBRARY_NAME)".

Next, it reads an image file "photo.jpg" using the "Imgcodecs.imread()" method.

Then, it loads a Cascade Classifier model "lbpcascade_frontalface.xml" using the "CascadeClassifier()" constructor.

After that, the code detects faces in the image using "cc.detectMultiScale(src, faceDetection)" method, which takes the input image and a MatOfRect object as parameters. The MatOfRect object is used to store the detected faces.

The number of detected faces is printed using the "System.out.println()" method.

Finally, for each detected face, the code draws a rectangle around it using "Imgproc.rectangle()" method. The output image is saved as "photo_out.jpg" using "Imgcodecs.imwrite()" method.

At the end, a message is printed to indicate that the face detection process has finished.




what is CascadeClassifier?

CascadeClassifier is a class in the OpenCV library used for object detection. It is based on the Viola-Jones algorithm and uses a trained classifier cascade, which is essentially a series of classifiers that evaluate different features of an image.

The CascadeClassifier can be used to detect objects of a specific type, such as faces, in an image or video stream. It works by scanning the image with a sliding window of various sizes and aspect ratios, and applying the classifier cascade to each window. If a window is classified as containing the target object, it is returned as a detection with a corresponding bounding box.

In the given Java code, the CascadeClassifier is used to detect faces in an image by loading a pre-trained classifier from an XML file and applying it to the input image.
